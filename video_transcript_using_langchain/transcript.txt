I was working at a financial firm in New
York City with a bunch of very smart
people and I had a brilliant boss I much
admired I went to my
boss and told him I was going to start a
company selling books on the
internet he took me on a long walk in
Central
Park listened carefully to me and
finally said that sounds like a really
good idea but it would be an even better
idea for someone who didn't already have
a good
job you can have a job or you can have a
career or you can have a calling and if
you can somehow figure out how to have a
calling you have hit the jackpot cuz
that's the big
deal I met Jeff basos 25 years ago and
he told me Dave I want you to invest in
my company what are you doing I'm going
to start a bookstore in my garage okay
I'm going to put it online people buy
buy online and I'm a ship out of my
garage but but if you invest in me
Dave someday I'm going to be the richest
man in the world I'll do over $100
billion first of all there is no such
thing as a100 billion 25 years ago
statistically there's no such thing
countries didn't have 100 our national
debt wasn't $100 billion and this dude's
telling me at 26 years old that he's
going to be the richest man in the world
cuz he has a garage and the
internet that was his truth do that no
but he did not he did not know it and
neither did I but the difference between
him and I is I was laughing scoffing and
jesting at him and he was already
applauding himself going at the right
way at the perfect time I'm going to
make as much as I can as quickly and I'm
sitting there going there's no way this
is going to be a big business do
something you're very passionate about
and don't try to chase
what is kind of the hot Passion of the
day seen in that light it really was a
difficult choice but ultimately I
decided I had to give it a
shot I didn't think I'd regret trying
and
failing and I suspected I would always
be haunted by a decision to not try at
all after much
consideration I took the less safe path
to follow my passion and I'm proud of
that
choice as a young boy I had been a
garage inventor I'd invented an
automatic gate closer out of cement
filed tires a solar cooker that didn't
work very well out of an umbrella and
aluminum
foil baking pan alarms to entrap my
siblings I'd always wanted to be an
inventor and she wanted me to follow my
passion was a mil military phrase that I
especially love and it says slow is
smooth and smooth is fast and I have
seen that in every Endeavor I've ever
been in that's the kind of thing that
really allows you to make progress you
know you get certain um gifts in life
and you want to take advantage of those
um but you I guess my advice on
adversity and uh success would be to be
be proud not of your gifts but of your
hard work and your choices so you know
you may be the kinds of gifts you get
like you know you might be really good
at math it might be really easy for you
that's a kind of gift um but practicing
that math and taking it to the next step
that could be very challenging and hard
um and take a lot of sweat that's a
choice you can't really be proud of your
gifts because they were given to you um
you can be great f for them and thankful
for them um and but your choices you
choose to work hard um you choose to do
hard things those are choices that you
can be proud
of you can choose we all get to choose
our life stories and um it's the choices
that Define us not our gifts everybody
in this room has many gifts um I have
many gifts you can never be proud of
your gifts because they're gifts they
were given to you you might be you know
tall and or you might be really good at
math or you might be extremely beautiful
or handsome or you know there or there
many gifts and you can only be proud
really of your choices because those are
the things that you are that you're that
you are acting on and one of the most
important choices that each of us has
and you know this just as well as I do
is um you can choose a life of ease and
comfort or you can choose a life of
service and
adventure and when you're 80 which one
of those things you think you're going
to be more proud of you're going to be
more proud of having chosen a life of
service and
Adventure never been a better time to be
alive I mean it's just an incredible the
amount of uh inspiration that the world
generates uh for me and I think for a
lot of people it's just it's insane the
amount of change and convention and
opportunity your life the life you
author from scratch on your own
begins how will you use your gifts what
choices will you make will
inertia be your guide or will you follow
your
passions will you follow
Dogma or will you be original
will you choose a life of
ease or a life of service and
Adventure will you wilt under
criticism or will you follow your
convictions will you Bluff it out when
you're
wrong or will you
apologize will you guard your
heart against
rejection or will you act when you fall
on
love will you play it safe or will you
be a little bit
swashbuckling when it's
tough will you give up or will you be
[Music]
relentless will you be a
cynic or will you be a
builder will you be
clever at the expense of
others or will you be
kind every time you figure out some way
of providing tools and services that
Empower other people to deploy their
creativity you're really on to something
you know you're very lucky if you have a
career a lot of people end up with a
job if you don't love your work you're
never going to be great at it Jules ver
Mark Twain Galileo Newton all the
Curious from the ages would have wanted
to be alive most of all right
now as a civilization we will have so
many gifts just as you as individuals
have so many individual gifts as you sit
before
me how will you use these gifts and will
you take pride in your gifts or pride in
your choices
